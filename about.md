This is the Open Data Process Framework (previously known as the Open Data
Publishing Framework). It aims to define a lightweight, standardised approach
to publishing, governing and consuming open data in support of open
innovation.

It was developed during a consulting engagement with ODI Leeds, and collects
best practice from across the Open Data community.

Contributions are welcomed.
