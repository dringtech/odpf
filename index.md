Welcome to the Open Data Process Framework (ODPF)!

This wiki contains a working draft of the Open Data Process Framework. This
framework aims to streamline the process of publishing, governing and consuming
Open Data by presenting a structured approach which collects and organises best
practice and guidance.
The framework is designed to be tailored and customised to meet the needs of
organisations and individuals. Visit the [Overview page][OVERVIEW] to read more.

## What's this about, then?

There are many benefits to Open Data publication, but it can sometimes feel
daunting to organisations or individuals new to the domain. This is, in part,
due to the wide-range of different concerns that must be considered and
addressed when making data free for anyone to use.

[ODNELLY]: /images/opendataelephant.png "Open Data is like an elephant. It looks and feels different depending on who you ask, and it can take a while to eat."

Concerns include

* Ownership and Provenance
* Quality
* Sensitivity and anonymisation
* Computational complexity
* 'Linkedness'
* Organisational willingness and capability
* Interpretation / meaningfulness
* Legal

The Open Data Elephant visually represents these concerns, by analogy to
[the story of the blind men and an elephant][BLINDMENELEPHANT]. This story
suggests that immediate experience or worldview may give only a partial view
of the overall problem. A key aim of the Open Data Process Framework is
to identify all these key concerns and place them in the broader context so
that the publishing effort can be successful and sustainable.

Another elephant-related issue is the means by which one eats it. Extending
the analogy past breaking point, when publishing open data, we must start
somewhere. Another aim of the Open Data Process Framework is to guide
publishing teams in an appropriate order of tasks. What are the important
things to resolve early on in the life of a project and which elements can be
left until later.
